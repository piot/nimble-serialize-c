== Nimble Protocol


=== Join Game Request

Sent by the client to the server, asking for the included local players to become participants in the game session.

Implemented by https://github.com/piot/nimble-serialize-c/blob/main/src/lib/client_out.c#L27[`nimbleSerializeClientOutGameJoin()`].

|Type | Name | Description

|U8
|Command
|`NimbleSerializeCmdJoinGameRequest` (0x01)

|<<Version>>
|Nimble Protocol Version
|The protocol version described in this document. Currently `0.0.1`.

|<<Version>>
|Application Version
|Since it is vital that the application is deterministic, you need to verify that everyone is using the exact same version of the application.

|U8
|Participant Count
|The number of participants that follows in the stream.

|U8 * Participant Count
|Local Player Identifier
|The local player identifier for the participant on the client. The client can select any unique identifier between 1-255. 0 is reserved.

|===

==== Version

The semantic version. Used for the Nimble Protocol and Application version.

=== Join Game Response

Sent by the server to the client, approving or denying the join game request. If participant count is 0, the request was denied.

Implemented in https://github.com/piot/nimble-serialize-c/blob/main/src/lib/server_out.c#L64[`nimbleSerializeServerOutGameJoinResponse()`].

|U8
|Participant Connection Id
|Game session unique identifier for the participant connection created when a join game request was approved.

|U8
|Participant Count
|The number of participant infos that follows the stream. If zero, the join request was denied.

|<<Participant Join Result>> * Participant Count
|Join Infos
|Assigned participant Ids for each participant in the participant connection. Client should mark Steps with the unique participant ids.

|===

==== Participant Join Result

Information about the local player identifier and their assigned participant id.

|Type | Name | Description

|U8
|Local Player Identifier
|Game session unique identifier for the local player on the client.

|U8
|Participant Id
|Game session assigned unique participant identifier for the local player on the client.

=== Download Game State Request

Sent from a client to a server to request the most recent game state that the server has knowledge of. The client usually only request it once, after receiving a successful Join Game Response.
Usually the complete state is only set on the server each X tick (X is usually around 30-60 ticks).

|The number of octets in the total state.

|U32

|BlobStreamOutEntrySend
|Blob Stream Out Entry format
a|See https://github.com/piot/blob-stream/blob/main/docs/index.md[BlobStream documentation] for specifics. But essentially it is:

* U8 Blob Stream Command (0x01)
* U32 ChunkID that follows
* U16 Chunk Octet Size. Usually 1024 octets for all chunks except maybe the last one.
* `U8 * Chunk Octet Size`. the Blob Stream Chunk.

|===





=== Game State Chunk Ack

Sent from the client to the server to acknowledge which chunks of the game state that have been received.

|Blob Stream In Logic format
a|See https://github.com/piot/blob-stream/blob/main/docs/index.md[BlobStream documentation] for specifics. But essentially it is:

* U8 Blob Stream Command (0x02)
* U32 ChunkID that the client is waiting for
* U32 Receive Mask with bits set for each chunk that the client has received.

=== Game Step Request

Send Steps (Human Player Inputs) from the client to the server. The Steps should be sent with redundancy, include all Steps that hasn't been acked by the server in <<Game Step Response>>.

Implemented by `https://github.com/piot/nimble-steps-serialize-c/blob/main/src/lib/pending_out_serialize.c#L11[nbsPendingStepsSerializeOutHeader()]`.

|Bit mask with bit set for each stepIds completely received after `Latest authoritative StepId`

|U32
|Start StepId
|The first stepId in the stream that follows.

|<<Multiple Steps For Participants>>

|The predicted combined steps for all the local players on the client.

|===





=== Game Step Response

Sent from the server to the client with the authoritative steps (combined Steps from all participants).

|U8
|Connection specific buffer count
|The number of steps contained at the connection specific incoming predicted steps.

|S8
|Authoritative StepId delta
|The difference between the last predicted stepId received and the current authoritative stepId. Negative values means that the client is behind the server and should increase the rate of predicting steps. A positive value means that the predicted steps are ahead of the assembly of authoritative steps. The higher the number, the higher the perceived latency for the inputs.

|U32
|Last Received StepId
|The last received stepId from the client.

|U32
|First StepId in range
|The first stepId in the range of steps that follows. It contains steps that the client has previously indicated that it is missing (determined from <<Game Step Request>>).

|U8
|Range Count
|The number of ranges following.

|<<Authoritative Step Range>> * Range Count
|Authoritative Step Ranges
|The authoritative step ranges that the client is probably missing.

|===

==== Authoritative Step Range

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Type | Name | Description

|U8
|Delta StepId
|The difference between the last stepId in the previous range. Or the `First StepId in range` if this is the first range.

|<<Multiple Steps For Participants>>
|Authoritative Steps
|The authoritative steps for all the participants in the game for this step range.
